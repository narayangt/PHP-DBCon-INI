# PHP-DBCon-INI
This is a API and it could be use while making PHP framework which handles database credentials, loads upon calls, return mysql database connection. I have tried to implement advance OOP with design patterns. 

This API saves information on a .ini.php file. which is safe method to save information from public access. Please have a look on source how it works. run try.php to see the result
